# Flashlight-Strobe-RoN
Presses customizable button with customized delay if another customized buttons was pressed.

Overview
This AutoHotkey script allows you to toggle a strobing flashlight effect in Ready or Not, where no native toggle or strobe functionality currently exists. Instead of tapping your flashlight key repeatedly, this script simulates a rapid on/off flash using a configurable timer.



How to Use
1. Requirements
 AutoHotkey ﻿﻿v1.1 must be installed on your PC﻿.

2. Setup
    ﻿Download the .exe/.ahk script and save it anywhere.
    Double-click the file to run it.
    You'll be asked to:
    Choose a toggle key (e.g. V)
    Choose your in-game flashlight key (e.g. J)
    Set your desired strobe delay (e.g. 50 ms)



3. Usage
    Press your toggle key (e.g. V) to start/stop the strobe effect.
    The system tray tooltip will indicate whether the strobe is ON or OFF.
    Press Ctrl + Flashlight Key (e.g. Ctrl + J) to safely exit the script.



Notes
    Make sure your in-game flashlight key matches what you enter into the script.
    This script runs globally but is designed specifically for use with Ready or Not.﻿
    The script uses very minimal resources and runs in the background (System Tray).
    Strobe delay is in milliseconds and controls how fast the script presses the flashlight key repeatedly.
